# TextEncrypter
In-house ANSI text encrypter for CS20

Source code for a Raspberry Pi text encrypter. The aim of the project is to create a program that will automatically detect and encrypt/decrypt text files on a USB key. 

The encryption method revolves around creation of a random encryption key to replace each individual character from the original file with. This encryption key will be stored in the encrypted file so that the file is able to be decrypted, with each file’s “encryption” being different.
